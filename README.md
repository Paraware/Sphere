### Welcome to Sphere's Prototype branch!<br>
Sphere is a minimalistic language designed for both software and Operating System Development. <br>
The language syntax is designed to balance readability and writability by minimizing the amount of characters required to write while maintaining the self-explanatory nature of the code and namings. <br><br>
This language uses Freestanding-compatible C/C++ code to minimize the amount of refactoring reuqired to get Sphere-written projects to run on both with and without an environment.<br>
<br>
